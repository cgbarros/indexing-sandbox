    <p>This page showcase a possible rendering problem (if you are not careful) in Google Search. All product data (links below) is processed by /script.js and fetched from /products.json, but this json asset is blocked by robots.txt. If you try to test the pages in a tool like <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">Mobile Friendly Test</a> you won't see any product data, but the browser loads it fine</p>
		<p>Most of the time something similar to what is showcased here happens when the website loads 3rd party assets that for some reason don't allow Googlebot to crawl them. The best way to find those is to look at View Tested Page > More Info > Page Resources in the Mobile Friendly Test or the Live Inspection in Search Console</p>
