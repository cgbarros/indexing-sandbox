# Indexing sandbox

This is collection of pages and server directives to test and showcase settings that will not allow pages to be indexed on Google.

Each of the pages here should show a different error in the Live URL test, from Search Console's [URL Inspection Tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289).

The server part is build using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) (a Python WSGI framework) mainly because that was the template more easily available at [Replit](https://repl.it). You can also fork this project and immediately test it via https://replit.com/@ElykSorab/indexing-sandbox.

The test page current URL is https://indexing-sandbox.elyksorab.repl.co. Since this is hosted at [replit](https://repl.it) it may take a while to load on the first try.
